<H3>Sometimes, the future knocks quietly other times, it shouts your name through the voice of a mother who’s held on through grief and grace. For her daughter Dami, this letter wasn’t just about admission—it was about affirmation. It was proof that dreams can still bloom even in the soil of sorrow. And today, that dream arrives, wrapped in an envelope and sealed with hope.</H3>

<h4>“Dami!” her mother’s voice rang from the hallway, excitement trembling in her tone. “I just received your admission letter from the mail lady!”
Dami practically flew down the stairs, her heart thumping with anticipation. “Wasn’t it delayed?” she asked, breathless.Her mother held up the crisp envelope, smiling despite the tears forming in her eyes. “I said, I just received your admission letter.”
Dami gasped. “Oh my God! Finally!” Her eyes sparkled as she took the letter from her mother’s hand. “At last, Mom. I can’t wait to get to school and experience what it’s like to be lectured. Thank you, Jesus... Delay is not denial.”
Her mother nodded, holding back her emotions. “You’re right, my gold. But please—stay the girl you’ve always been. You're all I have left... after your father...” Her voice broke.
Dami stepped forward, gently holding her mother’s hand. “Mom,” she whispered, “let Dad’s soul rest. No tears, please. He’d want us to smile.”
Her mother wiped her tears. “Oh, yes... you’re right,” she murmured with a small smile.
“So,” Dami began playfully, “when do I resume? I need to do just a bit of shopping.” Her mother raised a brow. “Shopping? Was it not just two weeks ago you and your friends bought half the market?”
Dami burst into laughter. “Mom, I was joking! But you know you’ve got the money—so why not enjoy it?”
They both laughed, the kind of laughter that softened sorrow and brought peace.“So, I’m stingy, abi?” her mom teased. “Okay o, I will spend all the money I have. And when we become short of money, we’ll open our mouths to the sky?”
She continued with mock seriousness, “Like I always say... saving is—”
Dami cut in, “The key. So we can have something to fall back on. Yeah, I got it. No repetition.”
“See your head.” Her mom smiled and tapped Dami lightly on the head.
“Ouch, Mom!” Dami said, smiling.
She sniffed and asked, “Mom, did you put something on?”
“Yehhh!” her mom shouted and ran to the kitchen.
Dami chased after her, laughing. “Ha! Mum, it’s now your turn!”
Her mom smiled. “That’s your business. Besides, your last sentence was wrong. It’s Mom, are you cooking? Not Mom, did you put something on fire, Miss Script Writer.”
“Yes, Mom,” Dami replied just as her phone rang. “Hello?” she said, stepping out of the kitchen.
“Hey baby girl, what’s up now?” a voice said from the other end.
“I’m good, and you? This one you called am I safe?” Dami asked playfully.
“You’re safe,” the friend laughed. “I just received my admission letter, and I’m resuming in two weeks.”
“Yeah, just received mine too. I’m resuming...” Dami checked the letter. “In three weeks’ time. Hold on a sec— is it the same school as mine?!”
